## Clean Code:
* Generally follows PEP-8
* Be mindful of variable naming and consider using other data structures to avoid the confusion of "p31, p32..."

## Good Documentation:
* Well-organized readme
* Clear comments
* Could make better use of markdown cells for explanation/analysis

## Proper Data Science:
Good comparison of candidate models, could stand to include additional explanation/markdown in modeling notebook
Consider doing additional feature engineering and selection testing before turning to regularization for feature selection


## Comments:
* Solidly covered all bases, could consider spending a bit more time overall on feature engineering/selection/analysis
